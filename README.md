# DataViz 2019

The global subject of this project was the visualization of "Climate Data".  
We as a group decided to concetrate our efforts on the ecological footprint and the overshoot day.  
Here we describe the dataset,the terms and how we decided to visualize the data.

The website build can be visited [here](https://dataviz9.github.io/).

# Ecological footprint

The ecological footprint is defined as the biologically productive area needed to provide for everything people use: fruits and vegetables, fish, wood, fibers, absorption of carbon dioxide from fossil fuel use, and space for buildings and roads. At a global scale, footprint shows how big humanity's demand is compared to what planet Earth can renew. [Global Footprint Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Footprint_Network) has calculated the ecological footprint from UN data sources for the world as a whole and for over 200 nations.  

The measurement unit of the ecological footprint is the [global hectare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_hectare).
